Revision history for App-ProgUtils

0.08    2014-07-13 (SHARYANTO)

        - Now can also search program in current directory or its path (e.g.
          "progless script.pl" or "progedit ../foo").


0.07    2014-07-11 (SHARYANTO)

        - [Bugfix] Adjust to Complete::Util 0.12.

        - If completion word contains "/" (like "../bin" or "/home/u1/") it
          means user wants to complete from filesystem, so we switch to using
          complete_file().


0.06    2014-07-02 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes.

        - [Bugfix] scripts/ or bin/ files need to have something like #!perl and
          not #!/usr/bin/env perl so it can be replaced to the path of perl when
          installing [RT#96884]
